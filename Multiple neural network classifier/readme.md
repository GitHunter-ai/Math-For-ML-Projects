# Neural Network Classifier from Scratch ðŸ§ 

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network (with one hidden layer) from scratch using NumPy. It supports binary classification tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Custom neural network class (`nn`) with:
  - 1 hidden layer
  - Sigmoid activation in the output
  - Tanh activation in hidden layer
- Manual forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Works with 2D toy datasets (`make_moons`, `make_circles`) and real datasets (`breast.csv`)
- 2D decision boundary plotting (for 2D datasets)
- Accuracy evaluation





## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Clone the repo** (or copy the files)
2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
